# Auto Delete Cloudformation Stacks for Branches

## Summary
This repo creates a docker image that can be used by CircleCI and DockerCompose, as well as a Github Action that can be used in Github Workflows. It deletes all non-stage and non-production cloudformation stacks of a given name. This helps reduce cost of AWS and time that it takes to clean up cloudformation stacks.

## When updating
Make sure you run the following commands when updating the action:
```
git add --all
git commit -m 'Updating action'
git push --follow-tags -u origin master
```

## Requirements
 - Only that the role has adequete permissions to delete the branch

## Examples to add to pipeline
